# Inheritance
## Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used states and behavior from other classes. If you want to inherit from superclass to subclass you should use extends keyword followed by the name of the superclass.

# Interface
## objects define their interaction with the outside world through the methods that they expose. Methods form the object's interface with the outside world. To implement this interface, the name of your class would change, and you'd use the implements keyword in the class declaration.

# Package
## A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own applications. This library is known as the "Application Programming Interface", or "API" for short. There are literally thousands of classes to choose from. This allows you, the programmer, to focus on the design of your particular application, rather than the infrastructure required to make it work.
