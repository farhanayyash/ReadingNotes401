# Linked Lists

## A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

## Type of linked list:
- singly 
- doubly

## Time for linked-list:
The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, in its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list. 

## adding nodes:
we can add a node at the first or at the last also we can add a node to the middle.

## Print Out Nodes
We can print all nodes in our linked list by a traverse in all our nodes and print the value for each one.
