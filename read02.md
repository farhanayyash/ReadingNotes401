# Packages and Import:
## Package = directory
### Java classes can be grouped together in packages. A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files. You declare packages when you define your Java program, and you name the packages you want to use from other libraries in an import statement.

# Package declaration:
### The first statement, other than comments, in a Java source file, must be the package declaration.

## Default package: 
### Altho all Java classes are in a directory, it's possible to omit the package declaration. For small programs, it's common to omit it, in which case Java creates what it calls a default package. Sun recommends that you do not use default packages.

## Package declaration syntax:
### package illustration;
## Imports:
### import javax.swing.*;

#  Java Loops:
- Simple for loop
- Enhanced for-each loop
- While loop
- Do-While loop

## For Loop:
A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.

## While Loop:
The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.

## Do-While Loop:
The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
